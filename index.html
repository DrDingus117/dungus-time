            Hello, I'm Marcus! I have autism, I love gaming, and I'm pursuing a degree in either Software Development or Cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is Georgio the Goober, king of the goobers. We've had him for years—he lived with my dad for a while, but now he's with us at my mom's.
        
           My main interest is gaming on many devices, or watching YouTube for most of the day.

           Something I need to do is get to my giant backlog of games I've accumulated from me just getting games I might never play.

            From September to November, Codecademy helped me learn the basics outside the classroom. It requires a subscription, which is fine for learning for a year or so. I wonder if Cybersecurity will require this?

        </p>
        <p>
    I just have this final project to complete for these three classes before I can let my mind rest for the remainder of the month.
        
    I wonder what's next after this. All I know for sure is that it will be complicated, but I've overcome bigger challenges before.

            I have some experience taking things apart and putting them back together. For example, I've taken apart my Steam Deck several times to swap the drive and fix the R1 bumper. Recently, I spent a day installing a new operating system called Bazzite. Apparently, it's better than SteamOS for gaming, although in my test with Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, I didn't notice any significant changes in performance.
            
            Most companies would rather say no to repairing or upgrading your devices so they can make more money when you buy a new one every time something breaks. This is where the Right to Repair movement comes in. But even if big corporations allow people to repair their devices, there's a caveat—they can just hike the prices of parts to take your money anyway.

           VS Code is the only code thing I use for now. My only experience for a skill is if I need to fix a device which doesn't always work out but mistakes are a nice steping stone to learning something.

           This is Cream the Rabbit, shes one of the many characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. Shes my favorite character because she's Bunny. 
           
           She also has a mom whose name is Vanilla. She has a Chao named Cheese. Cream, Cheese, and Vanilla. Someone at Sega was probably hungry when they named them.

           I got the exact model in the photo in april. It was only in Japanese where I had to mod it but I already planned to do that. I only got it for the nostalgia factor of playing games like Tomodachi Life, Super Mario 3D Land, Metroid Samus Returns, Kirby Triple Deluxe, and Kirby Planet Robobot to name a few.
           
           Recently though the SD card deccided it wanted to corrupt itself so I had to spend a coulple days getting everything back to normal. All I lost is all my saves so now I have to get 100% in some games once I have time.

           This is the last game thing I will talk about for now. I'm a collector of old consoles like the PS1 as an example

        This is the most recent console I've gotten back in October cause I've been wanting one ever since I tried the demo for Sonic Lost World at Walmart but didn't get one until a month ago.
        
        The only games I've finished so far are Super Mario 3D World and Zelda Breath of the Wild, But durring wenter break I plan to get to my backlog.

           This class so far has been fun, and I've learned a lot over the last few months. I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned for the next four quarters.

           My Github and Linkedin are linked on the about page if you want to see more of what I've done or contact me.
        
           This page might not look the best but for a first project I think it turned out okay. My websites will get better in the next year.

           Thank you for visiting the Dungus Page! and have a nice day!
